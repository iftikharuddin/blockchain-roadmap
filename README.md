# blockchain-roadmap
In this repository, I document all the valuable resources I've gathered during my journey to becoming a blockchain developer

# Courses/Tutorials to watch:

- I started with Patrick Collins course [Blockchain Developer, Smart Contract, & Solidity Course - Powered By AI - Beginner to Expert Course
| Foundry Edition 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI&list=PL4Rj_WH6yLgWe7TxankiqkrkVKXIwOP42)
* Make sure to build all the projects and add them to your GitHub for portfolio and practice.
* Finish as many challenges as possible in [speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
* Before diving into frontend integrations in **dApps**, ensure you have a solid grasp of JavaScript. If you're new to these languages, mastering React/Next.js and JavaScript is essential for seamless work on the frontend of decentralized applications (dApps).
