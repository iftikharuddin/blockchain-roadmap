* Make sure to build all the projects and add them to your GitHub for portfolio and practice.
* Finish as many challenges as possible in [speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
* Before diving into frontend integrations in **dApps**, ensure you have a solid grasp of JavaScript. If you're new to these languages, mastering React/Next.js and JavaScript is essential for seamless work on the frontend of decentralized applications (dApps).
